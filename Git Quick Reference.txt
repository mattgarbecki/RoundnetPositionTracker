Basic Git Cheat Sheet:

git <command>
Commands:
  status : Checks the state of your local repo. Shows all changes you've made
  pull : Pulls the latest updates to your branch from the remote repo (github)
  add <file-name> : Stages a single file to be committed
  add --all : Stages all files you've edited/added to be committed
  commit -m "<message>" : Commits all staged changes to your repo
  push : Pushes all of your local commits to the remote repo (github)
  **Can not push unless you have the most up-to-date version of your branch
  branch -a : Lists all branches
  branch <new name> : Creates a new branch from the branch you're currently working on
  checkout <branch name> : switches you over to your new branch (remember to pull when you switch)

Other  notes: 
 - Try not to push directly to master
 - Master should be kept functional at all time (once we have a working prototype, that is)
   - Do not merge branches unless the branch's code is stable
 - Push all of your code changes to whatever branch you're working on when you're finished working
 - Pull before you begin working
 - If you run into merge conflicts and aren't sure how to fix, let me know and I'll help the best I can
 - If you create a new branch and it tells you to set the upstream, just type whatever command it recommends you type
 - The gitignore prevents you from pushing certain files. Do not push builds or IDE files, add to the gitignore if your computer generates extra unneccessary files
